  <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

  <p id="paragraf">
    The <span>The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an 
    <span>Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. 
    Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
    <span>superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <span>Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter 
    in the management of the <span>Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement 
    revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study 
    program that will produce graduates who are 
    <span>prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs.</span> So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK 
    department which oversees vocational programs such as 
    <span>Building Engineering Education</span>, and 
    <span>Mechanical Engineering Education.</span> To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information 
    technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct 
    <span>resource sharing with the mathematics study program.</span>
